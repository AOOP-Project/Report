\section{Testing}
We tested the systems in isolation in single threaded cases  not to create the illusion that all of our functions are thread safe.
The methods not tested in these systems are ones that have no feasible way of causing errors in normal operating modes in single threaded operations.

[Unit test of renderer]
[Unit test of GameObject and components]
[Unit test of Prefabs]
[Unit test of map editor]
[Unit test of serialization \& deserialization]
