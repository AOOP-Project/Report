We have worked with version control systems previously, \textit{Git} mainly, so we have experience in this field. When working on the project we used the git repository hosting service \textit{GitHub} to maintain our common repository. We used the Microsoft Windows environment application \textit{GitBash} because we are used to its error logs and we felt like we could dive more into detail with what possibly could go wrong. Mainly because we just switched to the IDE \textit{IntelliJ} which has a different layout and handling algorithm when communicating with our repository on GitHub than previously used IDE’s such as \textit{VSCode}.
\\ \\
We tried to use a lot of the functionalities of GitHub to make sure our project link at GitHub maintained a professional look. We used the functionalities of Milestone/Issues/Tags/Releases/Git-pull requests and so on. Even if we did not really need most of it due to the fact that we mainly worked on the project using the new functionality of our common IDE - IntelliJ called \textit{CodeWithMe} (CWM). Where we could work together with the project in real-time, leaving us with less tendency of the very popular GIT merging conflicts. We were sometimes working on the same issues, and we felt like CWM helped us avoid these potential conflicts.
If we were not using CWM, we’d assign ourselves with different issues and branch out of the main repository to later merge together.
