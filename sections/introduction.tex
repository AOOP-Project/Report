This report contains a brief documentation of our implementation and design of a framework aimed to create games in java along with two games created using this framework. The two games created are Sokoban and SoundBoard. Since these two games share little resemblance to each other and require different capabilities it puts a lot of pressure on the overall flexibility of the framework. What allows the framework to accommodate these different needs is the proper usage of object oriented design patterns. These design patterns are: Model View Controller, Mediator (MVC) , Entity Component System (ECS) and Abstract Factory pattern. While good design patterns usually makes for easier to maintain code it does not take away the need for proper testing. The testing for the framework that was done was in two parts unit testing of the main interface (GameInstance) using JUnit and functional/integration testing done in both the framework and the two games utilizing the Intellij run in debug mode.
