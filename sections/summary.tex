The framework does achieve adequate functionality and robustness as it stands currently. Even though there are still areas where improvement would be need if the framework would contribute any sort of useful functionality compared to already established game libraries for Java. One such area would be the user experience, if the framework would pivot more towards the “ease of use” approach. An example of this would be StdDraw which does not offer any functionality over swing which it is built on but it does provide an easy interface in a neat package.

Currently the features that stand out with this framework would in our opinion be the map editor and the component system. These two in combination with the ObjectPrefab provide a nice balance between speed, flexibility and ease of use demonstrated in the two games created.
